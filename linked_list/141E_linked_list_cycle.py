"""
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, 
we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. 
If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
